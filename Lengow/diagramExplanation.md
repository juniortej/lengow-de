# Explanation and Reasoning
This diagram illustrates the relationships between the three main tables. Here's a detailed breakdown:

client_products (Client's Products)
Role: Contains your client’s product catalog.

Primary Key (PK): id. Each product has a unique identifier.

Relationship with matchings: A product from client_products can be matched to multiple market products.

Example: An "iPhone 15" from your client may be matched to several "iPhone 15" listings from different competitors.

* This represents a one-to-many relationship (client_products 1 -- * matchings). 

market_products (Market Products)
Role: Stores information about products listed by other online retailers (competitors).

Primary Key (PK): Composite key (shop_id, id). Each market product is uniquely identified by a combination of the shop identifier and the product’s internal identifier within that shop.

Relationship with matchings: A market product can also be referenced in multiple matchings entries.

This may occur if a single market product is relevant to several different client products (less common), or more typically, because the matchings table acts as a bridge.

* This is also a one-to-many relationship (market_products 1 -- * matchings).

matchings (Product Matchings)
Role: Acts as a junction (or associative) table. Its primary purpose is to link a specific client product to a specific product from a market/shop.

Primary Key (PK): matching_id. Each matching entry is unique.

### Foreign Keys (FK):

- product_id: References client_products.id – identifies which client product is involved in the match.

- market_shop_id and market_product_id: Together form a composite foreign key referencing market_products(shop_id, id) – identify the specific product (and shop) from the market side.

- Uniqueness Constraint: A UNIQUE KEY (unique_matching) on (product_id, market_shop_id, market_product_id) ensures that a specific combination of client product, shop, and market product appears only once in the matchings table. This prevents duplicate matchings.

PS: No Foreign Key Constraints at the Database Level
We can noted that foreign key constraints are typically not enforced at the database level but are instead managed at the application layer or during data loading into a data warehouse.

### Potential Advantages:

- Flexibility: Simplifies bulk data loading (ETL/ELT), since insert order constraints are relaxed.

- Performance: May slightly improve write operations (e.g., inserts and updates) by skipping constraint checks.

### Drawbacks and Risks:

- Data Integrity: The main risk is orphaned data. For instance, a matchings record might reference a product_id that no longer exists in client_products if the client product is deleted without also removing its matchings.

- Application Complexity: The responsibility for maintaining referential integrity shifts to the application logic, increasing code complexity and requiring strict discipline to avoid inconsistencies.

## Summary
The matchings table is central, linking client products to corresponding market products.

A single client_product can be linked to multiple matchings.

A market_product may also appear in multiple matchings.

Each matchings entry represents a unique link between a specific client_product and a specific market_product.

This data model provides a solid foundation for analyzing how your client’s offerings compare to those available in the market.
